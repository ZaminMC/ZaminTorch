# Vanilla Conformance Audit — the continuous verifier's report

The twenty-first and later verifier passes (the investigation stream that
began with PR #54). This file is the persistent record for findings whose
families have no findings doc yet: each finding carries a stable VT-NNN id,
its verification-pass history, and its disposition. When a finding
graduates to a fix, its family's own record (the findings doc, the Wave row
in `Torch-Arcetecture.txt` §29, the WORKLOG entry) takes over and the row
here closes with the PR link. The predecessor records: the fourteenth
pass's farming family (PRs #69-#71), the fifteenth's fall-path family
(PRs #72-#76, `FALL_PATH_FAMILY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`), the sixteenth's
item/orb envelope, the seventeenth's vine family (PR #79), the eighteenth's
hopper & container family (PRs #82/#86, `CHEST_FAMILY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`),
the nineteenth's explosion family (PR #85,
`EXPLOSION_FAMILY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`), and the twentieth's double-chest
correction (PR #86) with F-TC1 confirmed for its own lane.

Baseline for the twenty-first pass: `origin/develop` at `dcd2e139`
(2026-10-30, Waves FL4 + FL4-F1 landed — the per-dimension fluid
simulation the pass-20 queue statement had named "F-FL4"; the house
landed it as an architecture wave). The reference is `reference/1.8.8/`
(the Mojang-mapped decompile; the same tree the mechanics zip carries).

## The twenty-first pass — the FL4 wave's three demand-named tails, confirmed

The FL4 wave's own ledger named its discoveries: "the fire family's
per-dimension scheduling, the placement families' use-path world routing,
the ice family's melt arms" (each its own future pass). This pass took all
three up, verified each through the full three-pass discipline, and found a
fourth, larger shape underneath the second: the whole dig/use/place surface
— not just the placement families — is overworld-bound.

- **VT-001** — the fire family never ticks in the nether or the End
  (CONFIRMED, three passes complete, fix-ready).
- **VT-002** — the entire dig/use/place surface reads and writes the
  overworld field: nether gameplay is dead and nether actions corrupt the
  overworld (CONFIRMED, three passes complete, architecture-scoped — the
  bounded correction is specified below, its implementation is its own
  pass).
- **VT-003** — the ice family's melt and break-to-water arms are absent
  (CONFIRMED, three passes complete, fix-ready).

## VT-001 — the fire family never ticks in the nether or the End

**Subsystem:** block family scheduling / fire (all dimensions). **Status:**
CONFIRMED — three verification passes complete, fix-ready.

**Affected engine files and methods:**
- `server/EngineServer.java` — the fire wiring block (~lines 1139-1166):
  `FireBlocks.wire(..., world, endWorld, scheduledTickSystem, gameplayRandom)`
  and the sixteen AGE-state `registerTicker` calls, all against the
  OVERWORLD's `scheduledTickSystem`.
- `server/block/FireBlocks.java` — `PlacementListener.onBlockReplaced` (the
  `ticks.scheduleTick(position, newId, 30 + onAddedRolls.nextInt(10))` arm)
  and `tick` (the re-arm at the reference's line 165).
- `server/EngineServer.java` ~lines 2152-2156 — the nether/End
  `ScheduledTickSystem`s carry the FLUID families' tickers alone; no fire
  ticker is registered on either.

**Vanilla reference:** `reference/1.8.8/net/minecraft/block/FireBlock.java`
— `onAdded` (lines 318-326) schedules through `worldIn.scheduleTick` (the
world the flame stands in), and the reference's `ServerWorld` machinery
(`tickUpdates`, one queue per world) dispatches `tick(world, pos, state,
random)` in THAT world. `tick` lines 144-226: the age progression
(`i + random.nextInt(3) / 2`), the rain douse, the fuel-less death
(`!hasFlammableNeighbor && (!hasSolidTop || i > 3)` — lines 166-170), the
max-age 1/4 roll, the six burn walks, the spread box, and the End's
eternal-bedrock arm (lines 150-154: the `world.dimension` consult — the
engine's own `endWorld == world` check at `FireBlocks.tick`).

**Observed engine behavior:**
1. A flame placed in the nether (lava ignition, flint and steel, any arm)
   fires `PlacementListener.onBlockReplaced` on the nether's change
   listener — but the listener schedules through `FireBlocks.scheduledTicks`,
   the seam wired to the OVERWORLD's queue.
2. The overworld queue's entry then dies in `doScheduledTicks`'s
   same-family gate: at pop time the system reads `world.getBlock(pos)` —
   the OVERWORLD's cell at the nether's coordinates — which is not fire, so
   the entry is dropped (or, when the overworld cell happens to hold the
   same fire state, the OVERWORLD's flame receives a phantom extra tick).
3. The nether flame never ticks at all: no aging, no spread, no fuel
   consumption, no death, forever. The End is the same; the eternal-bedrock
   check is unreachable dead code there (it only runs inside a tick).

**Verification history:**
- **Pass 1 (source, 2026-10-31):** the wiring block read whole — the seam
  (`scheduledTickSystem`, constructed over the overworld at EngineServer
  ~1139), the sixteen overworld-only `registerTicker` calls, the
  `netherScheduledTicks`/`endScheduledTicks` registration sites (fluids
  only, ~2152-2156), and the listener's schedule arm. The reference's
  per-world schedule shape read beside it (`ServerWorld.tickUpdates`,
  `FireBlock.onAdded`'s `worldIn`).
- **Pass 2 (behavioral, 2026-10-31):** the discovery seat
  `DimensionTailsDiscoveryTest.theNetherFireOnStoneDiesOnItsFirstScheduledTick`
  — an `fire_age5` flame on a bare nether stone floor (no flammable
  neighbor, age > 3) must die on its first scheduled tick (the reference's
  lines 166-170 death); 240 completed nether ticks later the engine still
  holds `minecraft:fire_age5` — `expected: <minecraft:air> but was:
  <minecraft:fire_age5>`. Red on develop, exactly the frozen-flame law.
- **Pass 3 (independent re-verification, 2026-10-31):** the queue-level
  probe (run 2026-10-31, output verbatim): after the nether placement,
  `server.scheduledBlockTicks().pendingAt((64,101,64), fire_age5)` answers
  `BlockPosition[x=64, y=101, z=64], block=minecraft:fire_age5, due=37`
  with the OVERWORLD queue holding exactly that one entry — the nether
  flame's schedule physically sits in the overworld's queue. The
  compensating-behavior hunt found none: no fire ticker on the nether/End
  systems, no other dispatch path, and the mis-scheduled entry's
  same-family gate outcome traced in `ScheduledTickSystem.doScheduledTicks`
  (the drop). The engine's own javadoc claims the family is "FireBlock 1:1"
  — the misroute is not an intentional divergence; the FL4 wave's ledger
  itself names the tail as owed work.

**Proposed minimal correction:** parameterize the fire family per dimension
the FL4 fluid shape: register the sixteen AGE tickers on the nether's and
the End's `ScheduledTickSystem`s beside the overworld's, and route the
placement listener's schedule (and `tick`'s re-arm) through the CHANGED
world's own system (a `Map<EngineWorld, ScheduledTickSystem>` seam or the
per-world consult). The `endWorld == world` eternal check then becomes a
plain `world.dimension() == 1` read. The nether lava ignition path already
writes the flame into the nether world (FL4's FluidWorld adapters), so the
only moving parts are the seam and the registrations.

**Regression risks:** the overworld fire family's seats
(`FarmlandTrample`, the fire family's own tests, `BlockUpdateSystem`) must
stay green — the overworld wiring itself is untouched; the seats that pin
the nether/End flame's behavior are new.

## VT-002 — the dig/use/place surface is overworld-bound (the FL4 "use-path world routing" tail, whole)

**Subsystem:** player interaction (dig, use, place) across dimensions.
**Status:** CONFIRMED — three verification passes complete;
architecture-scoped (the bounded correction is specified below; its
implementation is its own pass, per the FL4 wave's own ledgering of the
placement-families tail).

**Affected engine files and methods:**
- `server/interaction/BlockInteractionService.java` — the single
  `private final EngineWorld world` (line 73, constructed at EngineServer
  ~3361 over the overworld) behind every dig/place walk:
  `miningStartOnTick`, `miningFinishOnTick`, `tryMineBlock`, `creativeBreakOnTick`,
  `placeOnTick`, `publishDrops` (the three-arg `spawnDropAtBlock` — the
  TF-9 dimension row's own "honest 0" javadoc names this class of tail),
  `tickMining`, `perTickProgress`, `isSubmerged`.
- `server/EngineServer.java` — the use-dispatch arms
  (`useItemArmOnTick`, `useBlockArmOnTick` and the ~40 family arms they
  call: `useFlintOnTick`, `useFarmingOnTick` (27 bare world consults),
  `placeSignOnTick`, `placeDoorOnTick`, `placeRailOnTick`,
  `toggleDoorOnTick`, `placeChestFacingOnTick`, `placeRedstoneTorchOnTick`,
  `placeBedOnTick`/`sleepOnTick`, `useDragonEggOnTick`, `useCakeOnTick`,
  ... — the full enumerated list was captured by a method-level scan:
  every arm consults the bare `world` field; only the FL4-migrated arms
  (`useBucketOnTick`, `useSpawnEggOnBlock`, `useEnderEyeInAir`,
  `useSpawnEggInAir`) read `worldFor(session.dimension())`.

**Vanilla reference:** `ServerPlayerInteractionManager` is constructed per
world and its `this.world` is the player's own; `handlePlayerDig` /
`handleItemUse` (ServerPlayNetworkHandler) operate on `player.getEntityWorld()`
— the dig, the use, and the placement all read and write the world the
player stands in, in every dimension.

**Observed engine behavior (the dig, through the real packet path):**
1. A player standing in the nether submits a survival dig at a nether
   target. Every gate and the break commit run against the OVERWORLD cell
   at the same coordinates: `miningStartOnTick` reads the overworld block
   to arm the session, `miningFinishWalk` reads it again, `tryMineBlock`
   commits `world.setBlock(target, air)` on the overworld.
2. Two observable outcomes, both wrong: the NETHER block never breaks
   (nether mining through the client path is impossible — the cell the
   engine consults is a different world's), and the OVERWORLD cell at the
   same coordinates is destroyed (persistent cross-dimension corruption
   through the ordinary dig packet: drops spawn, the block shatter FX
   plays, the overworld terrain is edited by a nether action).
3. The same law covers placement and use (the family arms above): a nether
   player's chest/sign/door/rail/bed placement and every block use write
   the overworld. The flint and steel arm lights a fire IN THE OVERWORLD at
   the nether's coordinates (and consults the overworld portal builder).

**Verification history:**
- **Pass 1 (source, 2026-10-31):** the service's single-world binding read
  whole (constructor, every `*OnTick` body); the method-level scan of the
  EngineServer use arms (bare `world.` vs `worldFor(session.dimension())`)
  enumerated the affected families; the protocol dig dispatch
  (`V18Connection.handleDigging` → `submitMining*`) confirmed no dimension
  routing exists upstream of the service either.
- **Pass 2 (behavioral, 2026-10-31):** the discovery seat
  `DimensionTailsDiscoveryTest.theNetherDigBreaksTheNetherBlockNotTheOverworldCell`
  — a stably-nether player (portal crossing, arrival frame cleared, the
  body grounded beside the target) digs a nether dirt cell with an
  overworld dirt probe at the same coordinates. BOTH halves red on
  develop: `expected: <minecraft:air> but was: <minecraft:dirt>` (the
  nether cell survives its own dig) and `expected: <minecraft:dirt> but
  was: <minecraft:air>` (the overworld probe is consumed by the nether
  dig — the corruption). The seat's design note: the probe holds the SAME
  block as the target, so every dig gate (digability, progress, the 0.7
  finish floor, the anti-cheat budget) passes identically against either
  cell — the WORLD CHOICE is the only variable.
- **Pass 3 (independent re-verification, 2026-10-31):** the
  compensating-behavior hunt across the whole path — the dig dispatch has
  no dimension routing (protocol → service), the service has no per-world
  state, and the only dimension-aware interaction arms are the FL4
  migrations (bucket, spawn egg, ender eye) — the pattern exists but was
  never applied to dig/place. The FL4 wave's own commit names "the
  placement families' use-path world routing" as the owed tail (not an
  intentional divergence). Reachability confirmed: nether players exist
  (the portal walk), the dig path is the ordinary client path, and the
  corrupted overworld cell persists through the delta storage.

**Bounded correction (the proposed shape, its own pass):** the reference's
per-world interaction manager, adapted: route every dig/use/place walk
through `worldFor(session.dimension())` at the service boundary — the
cheapest faithful shape is a per-call world resolution inside the
`*OnTick` arms (the session's dimension read once per walk, the same
`worldFor` consult the FL4 arms already use), with `publishDrops` taking
the four-arg TF-9 `spawnDropAtBlock` stamp. The family arms in
EngineServer migrate arm by arm (the FL4 precedent: the bucket path first,
the rest in their own passes). The full correction is too broad for a
single verifier PR; the dig path + the flint arm are the bounded first
slice (they unblock VT-001's flint-and-steel nether arm and the
frozen-nether-gameplay symptom), with the remaining families ledgered.

**Regression risks:** the overworld seats must stay green (the overworld
dimension resolves through the same consult); the anti-cheat budget and
the reach band are dimension-blind and unaffected; the nether/End arms
have no existing seats to break.

## VT-003 — the ice family's melt and break-to-water arms are absent

**Subsystem:** random ticks + the survival break walk (ice, snow layer).
**Status:** CONFIRMED — three verification passes complete, fix-ready.

**Affected engine files and methods:**
- `server/interaction/BlockInteractionService.java` — `tryMineBlock`: the
  break commits plain air (`commit(target, world.airType())`); no ice arm.
- `server/block/RandomTickSystem.java` — no ice or snow-layer family arm
  (the random-tick families: grass, leaves, crops, stems, cocoa, mycelium,
  the lit redstone ore, the cane/cactus, the nether wart, the fluids).

**Vanilla reference:**
- `reference/1.8.8/net/minecraft/block/IceBlock.java` — `tick` (lines
  66-77): block light `> 11 - getOpacity()` (0 for the translucent ice)
  melts the cell — `yeetsWater` dimensions (the nether) remove it, others
  drop (nothing — `getBaseDropCount` 0) and write `WATER`.
  `afterMinedByPlayer` (lines 33-60): the silk arm takes the cube; else
  `yeetsWater` removes; else `dropItems` (nothing) and, when the block
  below `blocksMovement() || isLiquid()`, the cell becomes
  `FLOWING_WATER`.
- `reference/1.8.8/net/minecraft/block/SnowLayerBlock.java` — `tick`
  (lines 115-119): block light `> 11` melts the layer away (the drops walk
  yields nothing — `getBaseDropCount` 0); `afterMinedByPlayer` drops
  `LAYERS + 1` snowballs (the engine's single-layer state's 2 — already
  landed by the mining-speed audit's DropService row).

**Observed engine behavior:** ice broken over a solid floor leaves AIR
(no water ever); ice and snow never melt beside torches or lava (no
random-tick arm); a frozen lake cut through never refills through ice
breaks; the nether's ice (placed or imported) never sublimates.

**Verification history:**
- **Pass 1 (source, 2026-10-31):** the reference pair read whole (both
  classes); the engine's break walk read end to end (`tryMineBlock` — the
  unconditional air commit, the afterMinedByPlayer hook surface) and the
  RandomTickSystem's family list enumerated — no ice/snow arm exists
  anywhere.
- **Pass 2 (behavioral, 2026-10-31):** the discovery seat
  `DimensionTailsDiscoveryTest.theBrokenIceBecomesWaterOverASolidFloor`
  — ice over stone, dug through the real survival path, must leave water
  (the reference's FLOWING_WATER write); the engine leaves air:
  `VT-003: the broken ice cell becomes water over the solid floor (got
  minecraft:air)`. Red on develop.
- **Pass 3 (independent re-verification, 2026-10-31):** the
  compensating-behavior hunt — the `SurvivalMinedListener` (EngineServer
  ~3576) handles the banner tile alone; the block-broken listener handles
  container spill; `DropService.dropsFor`'s ice row is the silk/cube
  drop split (cannot write blocks); nothing in the commit feedback path
  writes water. The FL4 wave's ledger names "the ice family's melt arms"
  as the owed tail. The engine's own `BuiltinBlocks` comment ("its bare
  hand melts it to nothing") describes the DROP law, not the cell law —
  the cell's water write is simply absent.

**Proposed minimal correction:** two arms, both overworld-shaped with the
per-dimension gate the reference carries: (1) the break arm — in the
survival break walk, an ice cell (no silk) whose world
`!yeetsWater()` and whose block below is movement-blocking or liquid
commits `FLOWING_WATER` instead of air (the nether's yeetsWater consult
rides the EngineWorld dimension profile FL4 introduced); (2) the melt arms
— ice and snow_layer join the RandomTickSystem's random-tick families
with the block-light `> 11` consult (the engine's `blockLightAt`), writing
water (ice, non-yeetsWater worlds) / removing (snow, and the nether's
ice) per the reference.

**Regression risks:** the ice slipperiness consults and the silk-drop row
are untouched; the melt arm's light consult must read BLOCK light only
(the reference's `LightType.BLOCK`), not the sky-max blend the grass arm
uses — a sky-blended consult would melt every surface ice at noon.

---

## The twenty-first pass's seats

`zamin-core/src/test/java/net/zaminmc/torch/server/DimensionTailsDiscoveryTest.java`
carries the three reference-pinned seats (one per finding). They are
RED on develop by contract — each asserts the REFERENCE law, and the file's
javadoc forbids re-pinning a seat to the engine's current answer to make
it pass. The fix branch that takes a finding up lifts its seat green and
rides it as the regression seat (the fourteenth pass's own
stash-verification pattern: the seat fails with the fix stashed, passes
with it applied).

Observed red output (develop `dcd2e139`, 2026-10-31, the full class run):

```
theNetherFireOnStoneDiesOnItsFirstScheduledTick FAILED
  VT-001: the nether flame ticks in the nether and dies its fuel-less death
  ==> expected: <minecraft:air> but was: <minecraft:fire_age5>
theNetherDigBreaksTheNetherBlockNotTheOverworldCell FAILED (2 failures)
  VT-002: the nether dig breaks the NETHER block (the reference's per-world manager)
  ==> expected: <minecraft:air> but was: <minecraft:dirt>
  VT-002: the overworld cell at the same coordinates is NOT part of a nether dig
  ==> expected: <minecraft:dirt> but was: <minecraft:air>
theBrokenIceBecomesWaterOverASolidFloor FAILED
  VT-003: the broken ice cell becomes water over the solid floor (got minecraft:air)
  ==> expected: <true> but was: <false>
```

The VT-002 seat's stabilization notes (for whoever lifts it): the portal
crossing leaves the body inside the arrival frame's portal cells and the
stand clock stays at its max — the reference's own 10-tick cooldown
(PlayerEntity line 315) is the only thing holding the return, so the seat
clears the arrival frame's portal cells on the crossing tick (a body that
lingers re-crosses and drags the dig out of the reach band for unrelated
reasons); and the stand rides `applyMovement(..., onGround=true)` —
`teleportPlayer` writes `onGround=false` and nothing re-arms it without
client movement packets, which parks the dig's airborne 5x divisor
(PlayerEntity.getMiningSpeed line 695) below the finish floor.

## Coverage ledger (the twenty-first pass's sweep)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Fire family — overworld tick/spread/burn (FireBlocks vs FireBlock) | inspected, verified 1:1 on the overworld path (the fourteenth-pass-era migration); the per-dimension arm is VT-001 |
| Fire family — nether/End scheduling | VT-001 (CONFIRMED) |
| Fluid family — per-dimension simulation | landed by FL4; not re-audited (the FL4 seats are the record) |
| Dig path — dimension routing | VT-002 (CONFIRMED) |
| Use/place families — dimension routing | VT-002 (CONFIRMED; the family-level scan is the finding's list) |
| Ice family — break-to-water, melt | VT-003 (CONFIRMED) |
| Snow layer — placement support/melt/drops | drops landed (the mining-speed audit); melt + the 7-layer state surface recorded as VT-003's tail |
| Packed ice — melt/break laws | inspected: the reference's PackedIceBlock carries no melt arm (the `setTicksRandomly` false, the silk-drop row landed); nothing owed |
| Portal mechanics (flag1, forcer) | landed by FL4-F1; not re-audited |
| Drops — the TF-9 dimension stamp | the overworld-bound `publishDrops` three-arg form recorded inside VT-002 (rides the same correction) |
| Explosions — dimension routing | not inspected this pass (secondary: no nether placement path exists until VT-002 lands — the tail is noted for the next pass) |
| Item entities / pickup — dimension | not inspected this pass (the TF-9 stamped sites are the FL4 record) |

## The queue for the next pass

1. **The VT-003 fix branch** (the ice family's two arms — the bounded,
   overworld-first slice, the per-dimension gate riding the FL4 profiles).
2. **The VT-001 fix branch** (the fire family's per-dimension seam + the
   sixteen registrations on the nether/End systems).
3. **The VT-002 bounded first slice** (the dig path + the flint arm
   through `worldFor(session.dimension())`), with the remaining family
   arms ledgered for their own passes.
4. The explosion-path dimension audit (the ledger row above).
5. The standing lanes from the earlier passes, untouched by this one:
   F-TC1 (the trapped chest's viewer signal, the twentieth pass's own
   confirmed queue head) and F-EC1 (the ender chest's solid-above gate,
   suspected).
